# HTML Spacing

### The Code
1. Open `spacing-issues-1.html` in Sublime. See how ugly the code looks!?
1. Open `spacing-issues-1.html` in Chrome. Everything seems fine, right? Well, yes the code "works" but if a bug does pop up it's going to be hard to locate because our code spacing is wonky.
1. I bet you've already guessed what we are going to do — format the HTML elements correctly. Woohoo!
1. Read through the [HTML STYLE GUIDE](https://github.com/sarah-codebug/html-style-guide) to get an understanding of how HTML pages should be formatted. 
1. Take what you've learned and apply it to the `spacing-issues-1.html` page. Format all the HTML code correctly. Make sure you intermittently refresh the page in Chrome to ensure you haven't messed anything up. 
  *Make sure you save your `spacing-issues-1.html` file in Sublime. Remember the trick where the filled-in circle by the filename means you have unsaved changes, and the small x means your file has been saved.* 
1. Once you feel like your HTML is formatted correctly, open up the `correct-1.html` page. Compare your work. Look very closely and make sure that all of your indentations are correct.  
1. Congratulations! You've just seen what it's like to work with a developer who doesn't space correctly :)!
1. Continue through the same steps for `spacing-issues-2.html` and `spacing-issume-3.html`!
